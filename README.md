Phylogenetic_Tree
=================

The codes and instructions on how to create a phylogenetic tree for domain analysis.

Prequsite: 

1. Download Hidden Markov Model from Pfam (or construct it by oneself.)

2. Download the preotoem sequences of selected species from online databases (E.g. Ensembl, JGI, NCBI, etc.)

3. Install required softwares, including Hmmer, clustalw, MEGA, PHYLIP, MrBayes, PAML, R, Perl, and Adobe Illustrator.

3 basic steps:

1. Search the domain hidden Markov model against whole preotoem sequences to get related sequences.

2. Do multiple sequences alignment among selected sequences.

3. Construct Phylogenetic Tree based on the Multiple Sequence Alignment.
